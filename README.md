# FEHM_supplementary
Current Version 1.0

Scripts to use LaGriT to prepare the neccesary run files for FEHM from pre-built surfaces

The class is currently built to take an externally generated surface and use it as the top of an oceanic crust layer.  The class will then populate an entire model space, generating node points, and using LaGriT to build connections.  It will then build zone files for material parameters and boundaries.  Using these, it will then generate the necessary input files for FEHM, setting you up for a super-sick modelling experience!
